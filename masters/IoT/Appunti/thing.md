Caratteristiche di un sensore: 
1. range: 
2. accuracy: indica quanto l'output Ã¨ preciso rispetto all'input 
3. sensitivit: you need certain change to see the change in the difital side 
4. stability: ability to keep the outputs stable if the input does not change 
5. Repeatibility:
6. Response Time: how fast the output reacts to an input change
7. Linearity: how much the range translates linearly to outputs -> in the increase on the input has a linear change on the output range; same change in the input translates to the same change in the output.   


analog data is a little more complex to extract data from but is very precise  

digital on the other hand is much simpler but it's less precise (for example a sound wave is not trasformable in a digital one, you need to approximate because we have finite number of bits at our disposal).
